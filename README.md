# Blockchain Learning Plan

- [ ] 1. Introduction to Blockchain: What is blockchain, history, and why it matters (Write a 1-page summary explaining blockchain in your own words)
- [ ] 2. Basic Cryptography: Hash functions, SHA-256, digital signatures (Implement SHA-256 hashing on text using Python/JS)
- [ ] 3. Types of Blockchain: Public, private, consortium (Compare 2 blockchain types and write a pros/cons table)
- [ ] 4. Blockchain Architecture: Blocks, chain, nodes, network (Draw a blockchain diagram showing nodes and blocks)
- [ ] 5. Transactions & Consensus Basics: How transactions are added, proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake (Simulate a small PoW consensus in Python)
- [ ] 6. Wallets & Keys: Public/private key pairs, addresses (Create a simple wallet generating key pairs)
- [ ] 7. Bitcoin Deep Dive: Bitcoin protocol, mining, UTXO (Analyze a Bitcoin block using a blockchain explorer)
- [ ] 8. Ethereum Deep Dive: Smart contracts, EVM, gas, accounts (Write a basic smart contract in Solidity)
- [ ] 9. Tokens & Standards: ERC-20, ERC-721 (Deploy a simple ERC-20 token on testnet)
- [ ] 10. Smart Contract Development: Solidity basics, functions, events (Build a “To-Do List” smart contract)
- [ ] 11. Development Tools: Remix, Truffle, Hardhat, Ganache (Set up Hardhat environment and run your first contract)
- [ ] 12. Test Networks & Deployment: Ropsten, Rinkeby, Goerli (Deploy your contract to a testnet)
- [ ] 13. Security in Blockchain: Reentrancy, overflow, access control (Audit a simple smart contract for vulnerabilities)
- [ ] 14. Decentralized Applications (dApps): Frontend-backend integration (Build a simple dApp connecting frontend to smart contract)
- [ ] 15. Oracles & Data Feeds: Chainlink, decentralized data access (Integrate a Chainlink price feed into your contract)
- [ ] 16. Advanced Consensus Mechanisms: Delegated PoS, BFT, Tendermint (Simulate a small BFT network in code)
- [ ] 17. Layer 2 & Scaling Solutions: Rollups, Plasma, sidechains (Explore Polygon testnet by deploying a contract)
- [ ] 18. Blockchain Interoperability: Polkadot, Cosmos (Build a small demo transferring assets across chains (mock))
- [ ] 19. NFTs & Gaming on Blockchain: ERC-721, ERC-1155, marketplaces (Create an NFT collection on a testnet)
- [ ] 20. DeFi Basics: Lending, borrowing, AMM, liquidity pools (Interact with a testnet DeFi protocol (like Aave or Uniswap))
- [ ] 21. Governance & DAOs: Voting, proposals, on-chain governance (Deploy a small DAO smart contract and test voting)
- [ ] 22. Privacy & Security Enhancements: zk-SNARKs, mixers, Tornado Cash (Explore zero-knowledge proof example in Circom)
- [ ] 23. Blockchain Analytics & Monitoring (Use tools like The Graph or Etherscan API to fetch data)
- [ ] 24. Advanced Smart Contract Patterns: Upgradeable contracts, proxies (Refactor a simple contract to be upgradeable)
- [ ] 25. Tokenomics & Incentives: Designing economic models (Design a token incentive system for a mock project)
- [ ] 26. Enterprise Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric, Corda (Set up a small Hyperledger Fabric network locally)
- [ ] 27. Regulatory & Legal Aspects: KYC, AML, compliance (Write a brief summary of blockchain regulations in your country)
- [ ] 28. Blockchain Project Architecture (Draft architecture for a blockchain-based voting system)
- [ ] 29. Security Audits & Best Practices (Audit your smart contracts using tools like Mythril or Slither)
- [ ] 30. Real-world Case Studies (Analyze 2 successful blockchain projects (e.g., Ethereum, Chainlink))
- [ ] 31. Scaling & Future Trends: Sharding, Ethereum 2.0, Web3 (Create a small project using layer 2 solutions)
- [ ] 32. Blockchain for Supply Chain, Healthcare, Education (Build a mock supply chain tracking contract)
- [ ] 33. Integrating AI & Blockchain (Design a concept integrating AI predictions with blockchain)
- [ ] 34. Capstone Project (Build a full blockchain project from scratch (wallet, smart contracts, frontend))
- [ ] 35. Documentation & Deployment (Write full documentation and deploy project to testnet/mainnet)
- [ ] 36. Reflection & Optimization (Review, optimize, and test your project thoroughly)
